# Data_Cleaning

Good data is the fuel that powers Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.<br />
Cleaning data ensures the quality,
In this repository, I will be putting some of my data cleaning practice codes.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>


Observations of the data usually a row of the dataset. Think if a row is not clean, we are misrepresenting to our model, the relationship between our features and our targets, messy data can lead to "garbage-in, garbage-out" effect.

- Ensure that our data is clean.
- There must be sufficient relevant data.
- Avoid data duplicates, that can bring extra weight to observations/unnecessary noise to model.
- Avoid inconsistent text and typos (wrong spelling, extra spaces, the capitalized/non-capitalized letters. This will all lead to the same feature, being categorized as                                      different values, even though they should be categorized as the same.)
- Missing data. (Null entries, and why they are null).
- Outliers (that can skew a feature disproportionately and make it difficult to find the true underlying model.)
- Data sourcing issues (Trouble bringing in data from multiple systems, or working with different database types, or trying to wrangle and combine data coming from on-                           premises versus on-the-cloud or many others).
